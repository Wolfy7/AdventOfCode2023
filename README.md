## Setup

I ran this code on python 3.11.1. It might work on other python 3 versions too.

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

Code for each day is in `Day_{i}/day{i}.py`.

Inputs for each day are in `Day_{i}/input_{i}.txt`.

Tests, using unittest, for each day are in `Day_{i}/test_day{i}.py`.
